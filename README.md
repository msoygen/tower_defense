a game project made for object oriented programming class.
written in Java with JavaFX

## Farewell
It was a very interesting project. I had wrote the game loop with JavaFx animation class.
It was a project made by me and my other 2 classmates. 

## If you ever wonder
I'll tell you how you can build this state of art :).
What did i use:
* javafx-sdk-11.0.2
* java version "1.8.0_251"
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_251-b08)
* Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.251-b08, mixed mode)
* javac 11.0.7
* adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot-amd64
* and the beautiful Visual Studio Code 
Just point the JavaFx SDK in the Visual Studio Code and run it.
