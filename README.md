a game project made for object oriented programming class.
written in Java with JavaFX

## Farewell
It was a very interesting project. I had wrote the game loop with JavaFx animation class.
It was a project made by me and my other 2 classmates. 

## If you ever wonder
I'll tell you how you can build this state of art :).
What did i use:
* javafx-sdk-11.0.2
* java version "1.8.0_251"
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_251-b08)
* Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.251-b08, mixed mode)
* javac 11.0.7
* adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot-amd64
* Visual Studio Code 

Just point the JavaFX SDK in the Visual Studio Code and run it. If you use an IDE then probably your IDE will detect JavaFX if installed or you can point the JavaFX SDK manually.
